## 🌟 GirlScript Summer of Code (GSSoC 2026)

We are proudly participating in **GSSoC 2026**! If you are a contributor from GSSoC, please ensure you follow these steps so that your PR is scored correctly:
1. **Approval Label**: Once your PR is reviewed and approved, we will add the `gssoc:approved` label. 
2. **Difficulty Level**: We will assign a difficulty label (`level:beginner`, `level:intermediate`, `level:advanced`, `level:critical`).
3. **Mentor Assignment**: We will add the `mentor:ritesh-1918` label to track review points.
4. Make sure your PR resolves an assigned issue and is linked properly in the PR description (e.g. `Fixes #28`).

## 💻 Pull Request Process

We follow a strict "Production Ready" workflow. All PRs must meet the following criteria:

1.  **Branching Strategy:**
    *   `feature/` — New features or logic.
    *   `fix/` — Bug fixes.
    *   `docs/` — Documentation updates.
    *   `refactor/` — Code cleanup without functional changes.
2.  **Atomic Commits:** Each commit should be a small, logical unit of work with a descriptive message.
3.  **Performance Check:** Any changes to the backend must be tested to ensure inference times remain **strictly under 500ms**.
4.  **UI Consistency:** Frontend changes must strictly adhere to our "Chaos to Clarity" design system (Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion).
5.  **Documentation:** If you add a new feature, you must update `PLATFORM_MAP.md`.

## 🛠️ Technical Standards

### Python (Backend)
*   Follow **PEP 8** style guidelines.
*   Use type hints for all function signatures.
*   Ensure all new endpoints are documented via FastAPI's automatic Swagger/Redoc UI.

### JavaScript/React (Frontend)
*   Use functional components and hooks.
*   Maintain central state management via **Zustand**.
*   Ensure components are responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

### AI & Data
*   Never commit raw datasets to the repository.
*   Ensure any model changes include a summary of evaluation metrics (F1-score, Accuracy).
